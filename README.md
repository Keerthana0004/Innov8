### Project Description
Stylenook is a modern eCommerce platform crafted to elevate the online dress shopping experience. Users can log in or sign up to access exclusive offers, explore detailed dress collections, and manage their shopping journey. The platform allows users to search for dresses using keywords or images, making it simple to find their desired styles. Additionally, Stylenook offers customization options where users can input personal details like height and weight for a more tailored shopping experience.
With a secure and user-friendly interface, Stylenook streamlines the entire shopping process, from browsing collections to adding items to the cart and completing purchases. The website focuses on delivering a personalized and seamless experience by combining convenience, customization, and detailed product information, setting itself apart as the go-to platform for dress¬†enthusiasts.

### The Problem statement
In the current online fashion retail landscape, customers often face challenges in finding dresses that fit perfectly and match their personal preferences. Many e-commerce platforms lack advanced personalization features, leading to issues such as incorrect size selection, limited customization options, and a tedious browsing experience. Additionally, searching for specific products using keywords can be clumzy and imprecise, failing to provide users who want quick and intuitive ways to discover items.
This project aims to address these points by developing a user-friendly e-commerce platform for dress shopping
